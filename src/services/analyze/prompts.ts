TASK
• For each category, score 0–5 using **SCORING_RUBRIC**.
• For each category, suggest as many specific improvements as possible, using the following format for each:
  - What is the problem? Be as specific as possible, referencing the exact section, heading, or line if relevant.
  - Provide a real, copy-pasteable example from the content (not a generic placeholder). The example should be clear and understandable to a non-technical user.
  - Give a detailed, actionable fix. If possible, provide the exact HTML, structured data, or code snippet to use as a fix. The fix should be explained in simple terms so that a non-technical user can understand what to do or ask a developer to do.
  - If multiple issues exist in a category, list each one separately.
  - Recommendations should be fully self-contained and understandable without additional context.
  - For each recommendation, assign an impact level: 'high', 'med', or 'low'.
• provide 4 recommendations tops.
• Respond **only** with valid JSON that matches **RESULT_SCHEMA**.
• IMPORTANT: Sort the recommendations array from highest to lowest impact (high → med → low).
• IMPORTANT: Ensure your entire JSON response fits within the allowed response length. If there are too many recommendations, only include the most important ones so the JSON is always complete and valid. Never exceed the response length limit (1000 tokens).
