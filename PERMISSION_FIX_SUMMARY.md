# 🔒 GitHub Actions Permission Error - Fixed

## Issue

GitHub Actions deployment was failing with:

```
Error: EACCES: permission denied, rmdir '/home/ec2-user/actions-runner/server/aeo-server/aeo-server/nginx/conf.d'
```

---

## ✅ Root Cause

Docker creates the `nginx/conf.d` directory with **root ownership** when mounting volumes. The GitHub Actions runner (running as regular user) cannot delete these root-owned files during checkout.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

Updated `.github/workflows/deploy-docker.yml` to fix permissions before checkout:

```yaml
- name: Fix permissions before checkout
  run: |
    # Fix ownership of directories that Docker might have created
    sudo chown -R $USER:$USER . 2>/dev/null || true
    echo "✅ Permissions fixed"

- name: Checkout source code
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

This ensures the runner always has permission to clean the workspace before pulling new code.

## 📚 Documentation Created

Created comprehensive troubleshooting guide:

- **[docs/troubleshooting/GITHUB_ACTIONS_PERMISSION_ERRORS.md](./docs/troubleshooting/GITHUB_ACTIONS_PERMISSION_ERRORS.md)**

Covers:

- ✅ Root cause explanation
- ✅ Manual fix steps
- ✅ Prevention strategies
- ✅ Related issues
- ✅ Debugging tips

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Commit and push the fix:**

   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/deploy-docker.yml docs/
   git commit -m "fix: Add permission fix for Docker-created directories in CI/CD

   - Fix permissions before checkout to prevent EACCES errors
   - Add comprehensive troubleshooting doc for permission issues
   - Update docs index with new guide
   "
   git push origin features/nir/cognito
   ```

2. **Run the workflow again** - It should now succeed without permission errors

3. **Verify** - Check that the "Fix permissions before checkout" step runs successfully
